## Features:

## Note:
To use bunnyhop feature you must unbind your bunnyhop jump key (default space) due to how its implemented.

Crashes when going into a new match after current one is done, due to CEngineClient/Source2EngineToClient001 GetIsInGame function not working under specific conditions.
